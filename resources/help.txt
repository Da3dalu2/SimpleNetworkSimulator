Send a message

After giving the identifier of the sender and of 
the recipient tells the sender 
to write a packet with the message given and to 
send it to its default gateway. 

Then the packet is forwaded to the server.

If the server sees the recipient client is online 
(checks its dictionary of 
online clients) then the message is sent to its 
default gateway.

The main router then checks if the packet should
 be forwaded to another router 
(checks its routing table) or to one of its 
clients.

If the packet is forwaded to the other router 
then it has reached its recipient client and 
the chain ends.
